# SICP & UC Berkeley CS 61A Problem Solutions

These are my solutions for SICP and the problem sets from Brian Harvey's CS 61A
course. These are the course materials I'm using:

- [Lectures](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter)
- [Homework, labs, and projects](http://wla.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/vol1.html)
- [UC Berkeley Scheme Programs](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/downloads/simply/)
- [UC Berkeley Scheme Reference](http://wla.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/word.txt)

Don't copy the UC Berkeley files from "harvey/" in this repo, use the link
above.  I have modified the source files according to [this
guide](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ssch27/appendix-running.html) to
make sure they run on my system. Therefore, they _may not_ run on yours.
